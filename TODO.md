TODO Gaps / bugs
- bar select should highlight the bar button
- Set a steps action, then click the button bar. I think the code to search back and find the prior step fucks it up
- Add sequence should add to all bars
- Set an action to a large step, then divide it by the button bar, not sure if it changes


TODO Features
XXX - list patterns
XXX - delete pattern (in list)
XXX - save pattern (current)
- save as
- delete pattern (existing)
- new pattern
- load actions (see action controller, they are currently init'd from a literal)
- add actions
- edit an action (there will be an active action set, you can edit it from there... otherwise you're working on new)
- delete an action (from editor)
- save action presets
- patterns should save their action palette (?)

- "play" mode - shows the current beat on the sequencer




TODO DONE DONE DONE
- make all 'add' buttons just a black fill with a + in it.
- clicking on a step in the pattern should set that row to the the active row
- clicking on an action type should turn the others' border dark.
