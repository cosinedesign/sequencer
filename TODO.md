TODO Gaps / bugs
- Set a steps action, then click the button bar. I think the code to search back and find the prior step fucks it up

TODO Features
- list patterns
- delete pattern (in list)
- save pattern (current)
- save as
- delete pattern (existing)
- new pattern
- load actions (see action controller, they are currently init'd from a literal)
- add actions
- edit an action (there will be an active action set, you can edit it from there... otherwise you're working on new)
- delete an action (from editor)
- make all 'add' buttons just a black fill with a + in it.

- patterns should save their action palette (?)






TODO DONE DONE DONE
- clicking on a step in the pattern should set that row to the the active row
- clicking on an action type should turn the others' border dark.
